Yes, but she will start first after Kate. Kate will introduce you and you can introduce your whole ticket. This is love, but it's OK. Yeah, don't need to introduce them. It's not right, actually, I'm sure, yeah.

[Unidentified Speaker]:

Katarina Milanovic (Presiding Officer):

Katarina Milanovic (Presiding Officer):
And then what did we forget? OK, cool. So everything's all set. Without further ado, I will welcome our...

[Unidentified Speaker]:
Thank you.

Katarina Milanovic (Presiding Officer):
Thank you. Actually, that was so good. Like a drama. Pause, everybody. OK, so tonight, as our agenda, I see already mentioned, we're gonna have even more people coming in. But we are usually very early in the last couple of months, so sometimes takes a while to fill the room. But we are here and we are starting. My job here is to check who has no idea about those messages.

[Unidentified Speaker]:
Everybody knows, OK, I can leave, you're done.

Katarina Milanovic (Presiding Officer):
I still need to introduce a little bit. So as you know, since you're sitting here, Toastmasters International in a second is going to work eventually is a nonprofit organization. We also refer to it as a learning platform. So you come here to practice your leadership skills and you also come here to practice your public speaking skills, right? And why we mentioned this is the best club in Shanghai. Of course, in our heart we usually don't like to compare because we have so many clubs and we are welcoming each other. But why we might be a bit different than other clubs is because in this club you can find many different nationalities. You can see the number. I will show you the number soon. We have people from 21 different region only in this club. So if you're looking for cultural exchange, you want to talk to people from different places, this is the place to come every Wednesday.

Another thing I want to mention is our club has 6 VTMS currently in the room. We have one so far and another one is late a bit. But if you don't know, VTM stands for Distinguished Postmaster. It's the highest level achievement you can successfully achieve if you spend years making different efforts, not only in speaking but also in leadership. Another thing I want to tell you or actually ask you, do we know who is this gentleman?

[Unidentified Speaker]:
Of course.

Katarina Milanovic (Presiding Officer):
So for those who don't know, this is the founder of Those Masters International. His name is Dr. Ralph C Smedley, and this is his photo. So just for your awareness, but my personal mission in this term is to show another person who is very important in Those Masters International and who actually helped US today to fill the half of this room. And this person is the first woman to join those masters. Anybody knows her name?

[Unidentified Speaker]:
Yes. Helen Blanchard. Helen.

[Unidentified Speaker]:
Thank you, Mr. DTM.

Katarina Milanovic (Presiding Officer):
Yes, Helen Blanchard. She's the first woman to join those masters international. But something that is really interesting is that this happened only 50 years ago. So those masters exist for 100 years and the 1st 50 years women couldn't be members. 50 years ago this lady joined the Toastmasters International under a false name under under the name of Homer. It took three years for her to actually be able to disclose that she's a woman and her name is actually Helen. So thanks to Helen, we have half of the room here and we can also have a woman president and everything else that you see around.

Without further ado, this is not yet what you're supposed to. Without further ado, I will give the stage to our TME that stands for those Masters of those masters of the evening. So this has some gentleman here. Is that a taboo? I don't know. He's gonna guide us through the session. 2 minutes of taboo. He will welcome each person who comes on stage. He won't explain everything you need to know and just keep an eye and your ear on him and enjoy the evening tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President, give you this.

## TME Introduction & Role Taker Introductions (Agenda: 19:00 - 19:05+)
(Approx. Duration: 5 minutes, 58 seconds)

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
I thank you. I already got fun. But yeah, I can be in stereo, right? OK. Good evening, everyone. How's everybody feeling Excited? Well, I'm certainly excited because we have a real celebrity. This team was. I'm sure everybody's really looking forward to hear his sharing about his transformation and change.

But before I invite him to the stage, let me first introduce three important role takers that will help us assure high quality meeting. They will give us feedback about our speaking habits and ways to improve them, as well as help us stay on time even though our timer was a little bit late.

So let's start with our counter. She comes from Ireland, she is a English teacher, but specifically for college students writing scientific papers. She runs half marathons, and she even joined our Spartan Race group. So this Sunday we have a Spartan Race. So let's put our hands together to warmly welcome Eva Koudelkova. *(Note: Corrected "on the Facebook" OCR error based on context)*

Eva Koudelkova (Ah-Counter):
Thank you very much. So good to see you all tonight. I will be the counter, which means I'll be counting any filler words like ah or umm that are used and people are thinking. So our experienced speakers so far have not used any of those words because as you might have seen, when they are thinking they will pause instead. So that's a good strategy to use. So I'll be counting the total number of as used by all speakers and also at the end revealing the a king or queen who uses the most. OK, so enjoy the speeches.

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
Thank you. If you want, Next is our grammarian. She describes herself as a sporadic guest coming to our meeting every now and then. She's in the automotive industry, works in grand marketing and she is a huge fan and follower of our guest speaker. And that's why we we are happy to have her here take her the Romanian role. So welcome Grace Wang, good evening, everyone.

Grace Wang (Grammarian):
Yes, I am a fan and I've been following you for a while, Thomas, So thanks for being here. My job as the grammarian this evening is to note the proper and improper use of grammar, vocabulary or any other English or non-english sounding phrases. But of course what I love to hear is to the better use or the beautiful use of the English language because the English language is beautiful. My other role for the evening is to introduce the word of the day. So I have the privilege to do this and choose the word that I chose is tenacious in light of the theme for this evening, which is change. So I imagine that we might need a lot of tenaciousness when thank you, thank you, you beat me to it. The rules are I'll explain them first. Then when you hear somebody within the evening, use the word tenacious, clap your hands and I'll be also be counseling the number of times that we use the word of the evening. So tenacious means holding firm to a purpose or being persistent and determined despite any difficulties or challenges. So please during the rest of the evening, note your use of tenacious and hopefully we'll have a lot of instances throughout the the day. So thank you.

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
Thank you. Really good choice of a word of the day. And last but not least, we have the most powerful person in the room and this is our timer. She comes from Kazakhstan. She has been a member for several years. She's our FFFT, which stands for First Female Foreign President. She is also our first female DTM Distinguished Toastmaster. *(Note: Corrected TTM to DTM)* She's a former area director. She's a successful entrepreneur, running her own company. Then I run away. She's she's coaching our sporting group. She's the one and on the Lazash I buy is everything. That's too much just for a timer, but thank you.

Buzzara Intbayeva (Timer):
That's your punishment for being late. So I'm going to help you with your time Management Today. You're lucky to have a timer in the room, so every speaker in the stage, please pay attention to these cards. Our keynote speaker is notified by time. Time goes red, 15 minutes, green, 17, yellow, 18, red, and then 23. I'm going to ring the bell and I'll wear table topic speakers later for all the guests. You have two minutes and then when one minute passes, I'm going to show you a green card, 1 1/2 yellow, 1-2 minutes red, and then 2 and 30. You're going to hear the bell, so please finish your speech earlier and I will prepare speakers. 5 minutes green, 6 minutes yellow, 6 1/2 red, and then 7 minutes.

## Keynote Speech (Agenda: 19:05 - 19:25)
(Approx. Duration: 25 minutes, 32 seconds)

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
I'm going to be tenacious with back to team meeting. All right, it's almost time to write our guest speaker to the stage. But before that, let me tell you a very short story. I arrived in Shanghai a little over 7 years ago. I didn't know any Chinese, I didn't know anybody, no friends or connections, and everything of course looked foreign and different. And like many other foreigners, I felt lost. And some colleagues suggested that maybe I should watch some funny Internet videos to get a little bit more acquainted with the life of foreigners in China, and I did so.

So there was, for example, a very funny video about the difference in between Chinese girlfriends from the North and from the South, including meeting them up, eating dinner, watching movies, even break out. But the best one, the funniest one that I still remember was made by one German guy and it was about meeting his girlfriend's parents. And it was so funny. He went dressed up like the mom and the dad and she reenacted the conversations. Like for example, the mom would say, oh, your skin is so white. Is my skin white too? Oh, don't call me your auntie, Call me your sister. Hey, waiter, waiter, bring a steak. All foreigners love eating steak. And then the dog will be like you doing Baijo do do you play mahjong cards? What you want to make my daughter? Do you have a car? Do you have a Shanghai license plate? You know what, you want to live in Germany? No, no, no. Shanghai is good. Shanghai is good. It was really hilarious. I cannot do it justice. I really recommend watching it. So in addition to being hilarious, I also felt that much to say. I also felt that this video is made with love and this made me also fell in love with living in China.

So without further ado, let's invite AFU, the guy that made this video with many others, Thomas Derksen to the stage to hear he's sharing about changes in life.

Thomas Derksen (Keynote Speaker):
Thank you everyone. Thank you for inviting me to this stage. My speech today is called A punch in the face and if we have the PPT here, we also can see it there. But before, no worries, before I start my speech, I want to tell you a little story on why I wanted to punch myself in the face yesterday.

So as you know, I am German, but my parents were actually born in Kazakhstan. Yeah. So in the Soviet Union at that time, there were a lot of German community. So I'm the only one in the family who was born in Germany. And my family, my brothers and sisters, all born in Kazakhstan, in the top. Yeah. So. And you know that we Germans, we are very good at organizing. We are very good at scheduling, Right. So I scheduled this speech with Bruce two months ago. And it was my calendar last weekend to friends from Beijing. We haven't. I have seen him for three years. He texted me and said, AFU, I will come to Shanghai. Are you free on Wednesday night? And I said, yes, yes, I'm free on Wednesday night. Let's go to dinner. So I have to say you, I have to apologize that I have a double date today. So I have a date with you, and I have a date with my friend. I haven't seen him for three years, so I have to leave a little bit earlier. So if you want to criticize my German English, you have to do it without me being here. But maybe you can take it on video. But I want to let you know You Beautiful people are my priority #1 So a big round of applause for yourself. Full timing Good.

I am a hobby boxer and I learned something from boxing for business and for life. And as you all here are leaders in one way or another, I wanted to share my learnings with you. Boxing. Sometimes it's very similar to situations that happen in our life. We all are very tenacious people, but sometimes you are very well prepared. You practiced a lot and then in the ring or in business or in life, so many unexpected things happen. Then you get a punch in the face by life. You maybe fall on the ground. Then you have to get yourself up again, and you have to be stronger. You have to come back stronger. So today I'm here to show you my learnings on how I learned to tackle the challenges, tackle the problems that life sometimes throws at us, and how we can become stronger and more resilient.

Can I control the... Yeah, you can control it. It's the middle button. Yeah. OK. The big one. The big one. Yeah, OK, Yes. So as I said, business is a lot like boxing. For boxing, you have to practice a lot. But then you step in the ring and then unexpected things happen because you train with your coach and he says left, right, hook, jab, right. But then your opponent comes and he throws some hooks and jabs you've never expected. And in life it's the same. How many of you here have ever, ever had this feeling that you have a good plan in your pocket and then something unexpected happens and destroys everything? How often have you thought, wow life is so smooth right now I have to feeling something will happen right? Kate is laughing. So you have an experience and how many of you have stored? I have so many problems, so many challenges, the best solution would be to lie down on the sofa and take a nap. So this something unexpected and it made everyone laugh. So thank you, Bruce, for that.

But not being prepared for the real problems, for the real challenges that life brings to us is a huge problem for you because it makes you as a human being, you as a leader, you as a business person, anxious. It makes you be scared of the future and it makes you hesitant. And in the end, it will cost you money, a lot of money, if you don't know how to tackle this problem. So let me tell you a story of my first job after I graduated from university. I got a really good job for. Yeah. This handsome. Yeah. In 2012. I think so. I got a really nice job and I didn't have to put a lot of effort in because in Germany we also have this concept called guanxi. We also have guanxi in Germany. My brother, who works in a bank, introduced me to a small German company. For them I should open office here in China. So this was a job for me with a lot of opportunities, a lot of responsibilities and also quite decent money. The boss said I pay you €3300 a month. At that time, like 15 years ago, this was a huge amount for me at the time just graduating from university. Little did I know this was money for pain and suffering.

My boss was can I use swear words here? My boss was a very bad boss. You just think now. Honestly, speaking like this was the worst job I've ever had. I had the feeling that his goal was to traumatize people, to make our country's life as hard as possible. Every morning you came to the office, you didn't know how his mood is. And he would would scream at people, he would make them feel bad. And I even had physical pain when I went to the office, my stomach hurt and I had to go to the doctor and he said there's nothing. Do you have stress at work? And this is actually a thing that your mental stress, mental health also can affect your physical health. So for me it was spam, a punch in the face. The dream job turned out to be a nightmare for me. So I didn't know what to do. But I decided to quit this job and leave Germany and come to China.

So, and after I came to China, I was quite successful in other people's eyes. I built up this platform with more than 10 million followers who followed me on different platforms in in the West and in China. And I did also a lot of consulting. I did consulting for for I traveled the world. I went to 30 plus countries to make videos. So I list other people's dreams. I did consulting for a lot of brands. I met celebrities like we call Kidman, like Lang Lang. Even when the German president came to China, I was part of the delegation and I had dinner in the People's Hall of Congress in the and I did, I did consulting for big companies like Volkswagen and Alipay and even for the German consulate and the Swiss Embassy.

So and with everyone I was talking, they all had the same experience. They all told me, AFU, everything is changing so fast, right? And when you think you have a good plan that bam, a new policy comes out and everything is destroyed. You think you have the best product, then your Chinese competitors come come out and they have a better product for a cheaper price, right? And then you have a perfect plan for your life, for your business, for your family, and bam, a new virus emerges and changes all our lives. So this is really a problem that bothers a lot of people, right? So during my business, during my boxing, during the social media, during everything I did in the last 10 years, I found out there are actually ways to tackle these problems, to be prepared for these problems. And these steps I want to share with you today. Yeah, this is me and waiting.

So #1 think positive. Who has ever heard this advice from business scooters or live coaches? Everyone, right? I want to tell you something. This is the worst advice ever. So my advice is think negative. Why? Good question so who here is singer Here is what singer singer tension go go. You are single. You are single right yes. So let's say **** met the the woman the woman on the thank you for the consideration in the 21st century after all, right right, We are very awful. We are very met the woman of his dreams online. She's beautiful, she's funny online. And then she says OK, I have to go on a date with her and he's already imagining this will be a wonderful evening. We will have a lot of fun fun. We will have a nice dinner and we will have the love of our life and maybe Hollywood will come and make a movie out of us, right? Then he goes there and he finds out all the pictures are fake. The woman is very boring and in the end he has to pay the whole bill because she doesn't have any money to make and switch, right? So OK, OK, how, how do you feel? Definitely very disappointed, lost trust in everything, you know, sad, right? So he is disappointed because he imagined everything would be very positive.

Now let's change it. Go **** or we take another one. You can sit down. Who is also singer You. What's your name? Samantha. So Samantha also met someone online and she said, OK, I'm single for five years now, let's go out on a date. And she thinks this guy, he seems to be a little bit boring, but whatever, let's meet him. Maybe he's ugly, maybe he's boring, but whatever. You have to thrush, right? So she goes there, and then she finds out, oh, actually, he's not the pet. He's kind of fun. He's kind of cute. And everything is better than you expected. And even if you would be ugly, even if you would be boring, you would just say, yeah, whatever. Thank you. Next one. So next one. Yeah. Think positive. Be prepared for the worst. I don't want you to be a grumpy old man or a grumpy old lady, right? Criticizing everything and being negative about everything. But if you are prepared for the negative, you set yourself up for being much more happy for the successes and the good things that happened in your life and #2 you reduce the your amount of disappointment #2 Zoom out here.

You see a picture of me in an ice bath. Has anyone done an ice bath before? No, no, we don't dare. I can tell you don't do it. We know when you do an ice bath, it's just a feeling of mental and physical pain. You feel pain everywhere. But I learned a very important lesson when I was doing an ice bath. My coach, she told me whatever you feel now will go over. An emotion has a lifetime of around 90 seconds. So when you feel something like pain, when you feel sadness, when you feel anxious, you just let it be. Don't try to push away the emotion because when you push away emotion, they will step up and then one day they will explode. So let the emotion be, and after a short time, the emotion will vanish naturally. So that's what I did, that's what I learned. And then you zoom out. You zoom out and you think, you ask yourself, in one year or in two years, will I still be anxious? Will I still be sad? Will I still be scared? And most of the time, the answer is no. The emotions we have today will not be relevant for us in two or three years. What dates do we have today? April 9th? April 9th? 3 years ago on April 9th. What did we do? Sit in the lockdown. We were sitting in the lockdown. And how did we feel? Crazy, depressing. Crazy. Depressed, right? Yeah. You felt right for me. I felt devastated for me. I thought this is the end of the world. Here you see a picture of me and my dog during the lockdown. I built a toilet for him because we couldn't go out. But now, three years later, all these feelings are gone. Hopefully, hopefully, we all are happy. We all are healthy and we all are thriving. So whenever you encounter these problems, zoom out, put them in the bigger frame and ask yourself, will I still feel the same in two or three years?

And the more you zoom out, the smaller the problems become #3 fall in love with the problems. I read a book by one of the biggest philosophers of our time called Curtis James Jackson AKA $0.50. He wrote a book and in this book he has a very powerful quote. He's actually a very smart and decent man. So besides his gangster rapper image, he actually has some lessons worth learning. So in his book he said every negative is a positive. The bad things that happened to me, I somehow make them good. That means you can't do anything to hurt me. We cannot ask life or the universe or God or Buddha, and we're not talking about the religion ever you believe in. We cannot ask it to not give us problems. We have to ask to give us the right kind of problems. And there's a scientific fact that solving problems, starting from puzzle solving or solving real life problems also gives us dopamine. So it gives us much more dopamine than you flirting with your dream woman. And it gives us the same dopamine like when we are doing sports. So I what I want you to do is to get addicted to the dopamine of problem solving. You have to expect that life will give you problems. And I know I wake up every day and I say, OK, what problems do I have to solve today? And then I go and I solve them.

Let me tell you a story on how I, oh, I have another. I have another quote of our big philosopher $0.50. He said in his one of the sunny days wouldn't be so special if it wasn't for rain. Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain. So let me tell you a story on how I learned these three action steps the hard way. As I told you, I had this amazing life. I travelled to 30 plus countries, I met superstars, celebrities. I also made some nice money on the way. 18 minutes. I have 23, right? Yeah. OK, something unexpected just happened, but I'm coming to the end. So I had this amazing life right here. But this all probably stopped over a year ago when my 12 years marriage ended. Because I'm a public person, people are very interested in my private life. And after I announced that we announced the end of our marriage, I got a huge... OK, it's not a problem. I have a huge network. I have so many friends who still still support me. I still have so many fans who support me, hate us, going to hate whatever you do, but still so many people supporting me. I have the knowledge that I that I everything I learned from the decades and doing social media. So maybe I can do. I can become a coach. I can become a speaker. And then I said, yeah, sure. This is what I want to do. If I start from zero, it's not 0. It's just that I have to change the perspective and use everything I learned, everything I built up from the last years till now. And then I said wow, and I came back to Shanghai and I started my new business, my new ventures. I do workshops now. I am coach for people, I'm actually doing speaker coaching for other people. And that's also why I'm here.

So this episode, using these three action steps really helped me to come from a mess to success. And I'm sure this will happen again in my life and it will happen always. It will always happen to you and to me. So starting from today, I hope that every, each and everyone of you will start to incorporate these into your daily life and into your business. Stay negative to share yourself for disaster because then you will be so happy if something succeeds, but you will not be as disappointed when something fails or go as you as you thought it might #2 zoom out, ask yourself, will this still matter to me in one or two years? Most of the times it's no #3 get addicted to problems. Don't get your dopamine from Instagram or Tinder, dopamine from solving problems to volunteer because this way is how champions are made. Thank you so much everyone.

Buzzara Intbayeva (Timer):

## Q&A for Keynote Speaker
(Approx. Duration: 2 minutes, 8 seconds)

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
We have one for question for Question Time for one question. Anybody have questions? Raise your hand. Everybody's so shy. My God. Oh, wow. OK, one question there.

[Unidentified Speaker]:
The lady behind you is yours, person. My question is just sorry. OK, Go ahead. So you made my time a little difficult at that time because you were the presenter before me. So you made a very funny speech and I was giving a very technical presentation. And today you, your speech is very inspiring, I think even better and I respect you even more up to date presentation. So my question to you... *(mic issue?)* It's working.

Thomas Derksen (Keynote Speaker):
So the one thing is that look for peoples build up a network that really supports you because whatever happens, whatever opinion people online have about you, there's always a group, A crowd of people offline. They will support everything you do. And when I say support, it doesn't mean to say everything you do is good. Because sometimes I have weird plans. I have weird thoughts. And these are the friends who say, OK, maybe this is a little bit weird. You can try it. And if you fail, I will say, yeah, I told you, right, But I'm still here for you. So these are people who like you, like you like your old T-shirt that's 10 years old. But you go to sleep, you know? You know, they are souls. You know, it's dirty sometimes, but you still love it. And you would never throw it away. So find these people who love you like you love your old sleeping T-shirt.

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
Thank you very much, Thomas. Unfortunately, we are out of time, but thank you so much for amazing sharing. And we have a little appreciation for you. Maybe we can take a picture together. OK, thanks. Thanks again. Amazing to have you here. So how did you guys like it? Did you like Thomas's sharing? Yeah, I also really enjoyed it. I have been also going on a kind of a roller coaster recently with lots of ups and downs. But life is what it is. Sometimes it's a roller coaster. You can either fall out or you can hang in and hope that it comes back up again. So let's all give Thomas another big round of applause.

## New Guest Introductions (Agenda: 19:45 - 20:01, shifted)
(Approx. Duration: 7 minutes, 2 seconds)

## Table Topics (Agenda: 19:25 - 19:45, shifted)
(Approx. Duration: 22 minutes, 52 seconds)

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
Welcome back. Time to start the second-half of our meeting. Apologies for switching the parts in the agenda a little bit. We we accommodated some last minute changes. So now we come to our Table Topic session. Table Topics is open to both members and guests. Anybody who wants to participate, just raise your hands and if you get picked, come to the stage to answer a question. Our Table Topics host tonight is an amazing, bright young lady. This table topic session is actually not only just table Topics, but it's also part of her Pathways project of engaging humor and more specific specifically to have Sorry About Active listening. She is one of our past presidents. She is the current area director. She works for venture capital investment company that specializes in high tech companies, something like that. And she has worked in China and in the US. Please warmly welcome Avril Zhang.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
How are you John to the change before I start, I was shocked by this room. Let me take a picture. Yay thank you. I'm happy I was late because hopefully after the refreshment more people will join this section and it will be a little bit special what we are what we'll do night. Basically, I have some cars and each car has a pulled and you will choose and you will let us know how you think about it. So. Oh, OK, that's great. We have a demo from a senior member. Paul.

Paul William James (Table Topics Speaker):
Hi. Hey. Hello, everyone.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
MMMM, this one, I don't need it for you. No. Yeah, I've got a better one. Yeah, OK. Oh, very classy. Which does not kill us makes us stronger. Which does not kill us makes us stronger. Very classic one. What do you think?

Paul William James (Table Topics Speaker):
OK, thank you very much. So that which does not kill us makes us stronger. I can really resonate with that. I work in a middle school and I was still talking to another middle school teacher earlier and for years I consciously said I will never work in an international store. I never work in a middle school. Because if you've never, if you go back to when you were a teenager and it's really difficult to be a teacher, the kids, they really badly behave. They swear at you. They push me down the stairs. Especially when you're teaching art, they really don't care about what you or what they're doing. And I was really for many, many years, I didn't want to do it. But my wife, she pushed me into it. She said the money is good, go for it, good career. So I decided let's do it. So I got the job as an art teacher in an International School and I survived the first year and I thought it would get easier and easier. Does it get easier? No, no, because every day, you know, it gets more and more difficult. There are kids who are really badly behave and this this one kid called Alex and he just throws paint everywhere and he writes really, really bad words in his sketchbook. But it's but him, it's his behaviour. I like him as a kid, I like all them. The kids are misbehaved and you know, you just got to embrace them and you just got to embrace the situation, have to embrace that negative situation and work your way for it. Just like the previous speaker, the one who said that when you're really at rock bottom, that's the best place to be because that's the time that you learn and you get stronger. There's a quote by Rumi. He said when you're down on your knees, when someone is pushing you, and that is the best time to pray. So when you are really, really down, that's the best place to start to go up. So thank you very much.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
Because I hate this book because it's so great and you are never killed and you just continuously embracing endless challenges. That's why I hate it. But it's right. OK. Next one. Yeah, please. I will. Welcome, Officer. Nice to meet you. OK, OK. Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right.

Dayne Forrest (Table Topics Speaker):
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. To really contemplate this quote, you need to exercise a certain level of tenacity. You need to be tenacious in a world that is sometimes in constant movement, constant change. As I'm through sharing with us, sometimes you need to learn to pivot enough. To pivot means that you need to be able to if you think about the situation and go with your gut instinct. Sometimes you could be right, sometimes it could be wrong. But in whose eyes are you right or wrong exactly? Absolutely do you. It's your opinion that ultimately matters. You are the one who's in control. You're the one directing the ship. Yes, if it doesn't go in the way that's expected, we have to say the consequences. But what's the kill you make if you stronger? And this is what helps us to learn to grow, to get stronger, to be better. But whatever whichever direction we choose to go, always know and seek solace in the fact that there are always going to be people who may not agree though, But then at the same time, there'll be people who will move with you. Choose to be the leader. Choose to be someone who people can look up to, who can admire. And that is by choosing your way, which ultimately is right away. Thank you.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
Yeah, I agree with this one. Every decision is actually up to us. And I also like dance on the stage, the gesture and everything. And you've got everybody listen to you quietly. Just what can make you even better is to give an example, do a storytelling like party. So we'll make this table topic even better. And this suggestion also give to the next one who want to try. OK, Actually this gentleman of this the first one I saw we can. Yeah, please. Tory. Tory.

Corey (Table Topics Speaker):
Yeah. And I have a body that's coming up.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
Next option. There it is. She can the traditional postmaster. Thank you. And choose a car. This one, OK, Action is the foundational key to all success.

Corey (Table Topics Speaker):
It's yours. Action is the foundation, even all success. This topic was incredibly interesting for me because actually all the speeches, they draw a line, they connect in some really fundamental way. We all know that phrase agape. It's to say that I think we're going to be OK. It's it's when you hit some sort of a challenge, when you're fired and you lose your job or things like the work are really in a bad place. People will say to be tenacious and and we'll say quotes that tell us that we need to dig deep and we need to stand up and don't think too much. That really, really brings us any salts because it's it's a quote. It's kind of like the same idea as I just said, the the real thing that we need is a prescription. What do we do? Where do we look to awful talked about $0.50 and yeah, that that was interesting because he said what did he say to them to remember what 50 Cent said? What was interesting to me was that what he said was exactly what somebody else said. About 2000 years ago, Marcus Aurelius said in his book Meditations about the challenge that he was going through. When you wake up in the morning, I want you to tell yourself something that is that today you're going to be dealing with people that are meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and Sir. That is because they don't see the difference between good and evil. I see the beauty of God, right? I cannot be hurt and I cannot have hate or anger towards other people because we are born alike. 2 feet, two hands, two eyes, 2 rows of teeth, upper and lower. We were made to work together. And if we don't work together, that's obstruction. And when I feel angry or might betray someone else, that's just a natural obstruction. So essentially, oh jeez, I lost my time. My, my last sentence would just be if I can break the time is, is is the history is repeating itself. And to be honest, we're all doing the same. This prescription is that we can lean on each other and then we can letters again. Thank you.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
I feel I lost in time with you as well and I'll go ahead and see a quote from the the share sharing. I will definitely check later. And oh, someone just couldn't wait. Can I get a lady this time? Oh, OK. It's very similar, actually. The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.

Alice Fan (Table Topics Speaker):
Yeah, to your story, it is yours. My quote is the way to get started is to quit talking and be begin doing. I think there's one I can refer to after sharing the king of speech that he was talking about his experience when he was like quite like depressed because of what happened after his like fell down, become the divorce or like all the haters from the Internet. Then he went to Thailand to do this boxing training. This is the exactly way that when we are facing something, when we have a problem, of course, you need time to process. You need time to fail, to know, to to realize the problem. But you still need to think about a way to get rid of this, to find a way out and then to move on. So this is a time that we need to do some action. You really have the problem and then you find a way how to deal with this problem, how to solve the problem. This is the very important thing to goes through whatever happened in your life because of course, life is they are so much uncertainties in life. Sometimes you learn, sometimes you, sometimes you learn, sometimes you learn. So it's very common that not everything goes as we expected. But when this kind of problem happens, when we are facing some, when we encounter some unexpected stuff we had, we should have the strengths to face. At the same time, we should be brave enough and also be tenacious to to face, to embrace the problems and then to find a way to solve it and then move on. Thank you.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
Thank you. And I like the way that you also quoted the story from our sharing speaker. And this time you described it. Yeah. Oh, OK. So many people. How to choose. OK. But I, I noticed someone I didn't choose last round. So surely. Yes. OK. And this 10 Into the anthem moves the world. Into the anthem moves the world. OK, Stage is yours.

Shirley Li (Table Topics Speaker):
Yeah, OK. Looking back in my life, I think I always open the mixed up person in my life even though I think I do. I didn't get a good education, maybe my back grade not not not good, but I still have a good pain in the future. For example, after I graduate from the university, I work in the the company. The company need to work overtime. I need to spend the whole time from maybe the 9:00 AM to maybe 11:00 PM. Yeah, I need to earn money to for living. I also need to to in through myself to compare with the the same aid. What's my motivation is is as you enthusiasm that is supposed me to do everything he supposed me to. I can work overtime and also to have the good attitudes with my clients or customers. I I also sense that this period of time because that actually don't count kill me that me me, me, me feel stronger. So always keep the I feel easy. Let me the lab go go in the future. I will be there have a good achieve my goal. So I I always always believe I will be very feel feel training in in my life. So I don't worry. I just keep enthusiastic attitudes in my life, and I also want to encourage others lively the shortly don't like others, they defend you. You can be defend yourself. Keep keep going, keep learning. You will be better. Just compare yourself. Don't compare others. You will be inner peaceful, inner quiet in your life.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
Yeah, you like my? I came through because I invited Shirley join the project team, and she's so supportive and energetic all the time. Exactly what she describes who she is. Thank you, Shirley. Oh, last one. OK, last one. OK. Let's give this to a guest in front of Shark. Yeah, please click this one and choose. OK, let's see if we are not ashamed to think it. We should not be ashamed to say it.

Joel (Table Topics Speaker):
The voting system we are not ashamed to think of. We should not be ashamed to say it. I'm wondering if the person who wrote this lived up to this quote and what their life looked like. Because as I'm standing here reading it, I'm thinking about the fact that we all have thoughts. We all have purges. We all have ideas that are better left on said. So maybe the point was to get people up here and to voice connections to the quote and why we should live up to this quote and how those quotes should be embodied in our lives, past, present and future. But I'm here today to say that I disagree with this quote. I shape that acknowledging that our inner workings and our inner thoughts sometimes go a little bit stray and they go a little bit down this way and a little bit down that way, and then sometimes they go up and down and they don't need to come out here, they need to stay there. And the world is a better place for it. We need to know our audience. We need to know our purpose. And there are people in our lives where maybe some of those thoughts are better shared with. There are people in our lives who maybe we tenaciously will share these things with. But at Toastmasters on my first meeting, it's probably not the time to start telling you guys all of my innermost thoughts. You might never want me back here again, and that's not why I came here for the first time. OK, so I don't remember the exact wording, but the short, the long and short of it is, some things are better left on set. I disagree with the quote and be brave. Share your truth when you can, but sometimes just keep it inside. You're better off for it. Thank you.

Avril Zhang (Table Topics Master):
I'm wondering what's are in your mind? So I'm I'm not surprised because before I started this, someone also disagreed with this call. But I think for this code just providing a different angle for you all, it's actually especially for Toastmaster meeting, just like table topics, if you have opinions, if you have something that you're thinking to present, to express, you just do it. You just get on the stage. Let's see this sentence in this angle. OK, OK, thank you everyone. Hope you enjoy my topics.

## Prepared Speeches (Agenda: 20:01 - 20:28)
(Approx. Duration: 20 minutes, 6 seconds)

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
Yeah, thank you very much. I really like how well prepared our table topic master Avril was. She, she came prepared with the questions, the question card, and she handled the entire table topics session very well, even providing immediate comments and feedback to everybody that did the table topics. So let's all give her a big round of applause again.

So next in our agenda are the prepared speeches. We have three members of our Toastmasters Leadership Club that have prepared speeches and they will deliver them tonight. After that we will hear evaluations on their speeches and in this evaluations we will hear from the evaluators how we can improve these speeches, what was done well and what can be further improved.

So our first speaker, she joined the club about half a year ago. She's a brave and strong young lady that likes cycling, ballet and opera. Her project today is Presentation Mastery PM 1.3 Introduction to Vocal Variety. The objective is to practice using vocal variety or body language to enhance the speech. The evaluator is Kyle Wei and the title of the speech is Once I Have a Dream. Let's invite Samantha Yan to the stage.

Samantha Yan (Prepared Speaker 1):
Once I had a dream the mic is off, open it again. She just accidentally. She just accidentally In Senior High School, I did one thing that any other teenage girl would do Harvest war was the biggest in a city with 3000 students, meaning not a place that everyone would know each other right That y'all love was forbidden by still happened and my eyes y'all love was just wasting the one day when I was just resting and one boy stand up and two be filled his water, his water bottle. He was tall, skinny, not the most handsome guy any classroom, but he has something that reminded me of some Chinese sort men. You know all the wig full of ambition and full of knowledge. Yes guys I had to crush something and as a teenager girl I started to have sweet drinks. I wish I could sit next to him, I wish I could talk to him, I wish I could. I wish you know me.

I soon I realized this was unlike let's let's see students and my class. And that means he would only know his roommates, his roommates, and people sitting around him, so he wouldn't know me. And we were, if I was sitting a stage, who would be sitting at the door? There were 55 students and a blocks of books anyway, and from 7th to 9 we're packed with stupid classes so there were zero opportunities for us to talk in private. Additionally, he performed very well in art, No in science related subjects. And I've done very well in art. No, everyone did very well in science related subjects. I've performed very well in art related subjects. Which means we will not be in the same classroom and in the near future. So we will never talk, never sit together. Our eyes will never look. And you will know me. So that's the end of my love story, my friends.

But time went fine. One day when I was having dinner in my canteen, our canteen was a little bit abnormal. Guys, have you been to the factory? Have you been to the factory? Yes Sir that's our canteen big. It's really hard to bump into any classmates let alone so men. So I was just eating as usual my wife just is standing around just when my head turned on left side and I realized I have to take my head quickly back. Guess what what happened if the boy yes bang on I spotted a long plain shadow. It was him, a suit man and this was my friends They they we were never ever ever never so close and that movements I panicked Oh my God, Oh my God. I would like to talk to him. I wish I could know him, but I didn't have the coverage. Just when I was conflicting and then something that really surprised me, he was walking. He was walking holds my interaction with The Walking. He was walking closer, closer, closer, closer and stopped and my table and then and with his hands in this stupid ugly uniform and he leaned forwards and lowered his body, looked into my eyes and implying that he knew me and that said one word that I never find this word so many. And he said, my friends, I'm not an actress. No man. It's really hard for me to repeat his word. But any more. I was exhilarated. He came near me. He talked to me, he locked his eyes with me. And he he knew me and I was. That was the happiest day of my life, my friends. This experience motivated me even today, even right now on stage. You know why this is more than a love story. And later I found out that is because once I dream that dream, I know my my friends, you know, you may not have the same dream as me as a teenager or wanting my cross to come near me, but you possibly have other dreams to have your company, to have a new job, you have a new house to bounce back from your last difficulty. And I want you to remember that you will country when it does. It's powerful.

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Samantha. What a lovely love story you shared. Thank you so much. Everybody was everybody. I looked at the people, everybody was really enchanted listening to your story. Really great job. Thank you.

Our next speaker. She joined the club in 2018. She likes speaking, she likes running actually I have met her by chance running at the Jingan Walker Stadium and she also likes yoga. Her project is Presentation Mastery 1.4.1 Evaluation and Feedback. The objective is to practice applying feedback to improve speech. The evaluator is VJ Basang. There's VJ, and the title of the speech is Endorphin. Let's warmly welcome Fay Ding to the Stage. *(Note: Inferred "Fading" -> Fay Ding)*

Fay Ding (Prepared Speaker 2):
Thank you. Thank you. Because that in my speech, I want to ask you 2 questions. Question one, how many of you have the habit to walk out like running, like swimming? Rest your hands, rest your hands, rest your hands, rest your hands. Oh, great to see so many of the hands. Question 2. How many of you have the feeling of the energizing of the rush? Like your power is boosting After the workout things rest your head. Wow, so many of you enjoy this wonderful thing.

So tonight my speech is just to tell you to explore the scientific mirrors, the scientific negligence for this wonderful feelings. That is one times of the importance of chemical messages in our physical body. That is the end of things if the Angel things make you to have this wonderful things like the angels. So the are is very high. So this word anythings is the combination from this two word worldwide. Endogenous means external morphine. How many of you know morphine? Yeah, Yes. My favorite pain killers. If you got the your boy is broken in the hospital, you feel white, you want to die, then the doctor will inject you one hand with the morphine immediately. Then that's a strong power. The heavy painful will disappear immediately. So it means that our body could generate these pain killers by ourselves. So where does it come from? It's come from the here generated by our brain. Our brain, there's two key important areas. Everyone is hyper synonymous, said Sheila. That every two is pituitary. So these two important parts is our internal pharmacist, internal pharmacist, it could generate a lot of different kinds of chemical messages. So endorphin is also one kind of important chemical messages to like you to have this kind of wonderful feeling. This feeling, if you think that this is a thing, can only make you to have the mood boosters or length of penis. It has a lot of the functions.

So next part I want to, uh, ask you apart from the exercise. I like I asked the question one Meadows woke up and other kinds of the moments could generate the end of chemicals. Do you know that is there some joyful moments that could also make our brain to generate this chemical messages? Anyone know that or. OK, so I want to share some of the three interesting moments that could also make your brain to generate this endocrine chemical, this chemical messages. The first you want is big smile. Yeah. So when you smile, your brain will automatically generate this kind of the chemical messages to make you super happy. Your heart is open. Second one is meditation. So when you really focus on doing something or doing the meditation in there, it means like a kind of the heart flow you go into that status and your brain will also generate this kind of chemical messages to make you have this wonderful feeling. The third one is easy and that is a warm heart. So if you think that's a little bit unhappy and you killer, the easy way to make your brain to generate the interface is just ask the warm hug from your friends, from your family, from any people you loved. And the warm hug happily could make your brain to generate these chemical messages too, to make you to go out of that elective status.

So then the last part I want to ask you, what is the benefits for this this endorphins function to us apart from the late nature pain killers and the other kind of the functions for these chemicals, happiness, pen killers, happiness, happiness. Happiness makes us happy, making us say they're happy. Yeah, just for like some of the speech tonight. You say enjoy the problems, go through with any problems. So, oh, you can't think why you can go through problems, you can enjoy the problem. What kind of the hormone chemicals drive you to go through the problems that is the Angel face. So the Angel face is over is one kind of the important thing to make you to have the ability of resilience. So if you want to have the ability of resilience, if you claims that I want to enjoy the problem solver and addicted the problem, you will also lead the to claim to yourself. I also need my body to generate endorphins, more generous, more endorphins. So the second important goal function for the endorphins, for us, it is our mental health gathering. See our mental health gathering for the endorphins. So stress, anxiety and unhappy or depression survive in silence everywhere and it could accumulate automatically in our body and give our body damage in the later. So how can we combat with them? That's kind of important. Chemical is endorphins. So when you realize you are happy depressed depression, try to tell yourself I need some endorphins. So how can we gather in endorphins? Think of these activities a part of exercise or some joyful moment. So the last sentence I want to share with all of you that says the best of fallacy is the one inside of you. Please feel this prescription of the every day in your life. Thank you, thank you.

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
Thanks a lot to Fay for teaching us about this important happiness hormone called endorphin. Let's review. How do we get more endorphin? Hugging. Hugging. That's one. What is the second one? Nothing. Nothing. Also exercise. Exercise. Spicy food. What about hearts? Hearts. Hearts. Meditation. Meditation. Great. Thank you, Faith. Let's give her another round of applause.

Our last speaker for tonight openly admits that she's still on a journey, and that's her journey to master the art of humor. She admits that talking jokes, especially in English, is still difficult, but she's very tenacious and she master this art. She's coming to our club's treasurer, but even more important than that, she's all our own Toastmasters encyclopedia, so we affectionately call her Wikipedia. Yes, she's a marketing strategist and brand developer, and also an amazing photographer. Her project today is Persuasive Influence Level 4.1. Know your sense of humor. The objective is to develop a collection of humorous stories and deliver a humorous speech. Our evaluator is Paul William James and the title of the speech is For Peace of Mind. Let's warmly welcome Victoria Li to the big A good day all the same.

Victoria Li (Prepared Speaker 3):
Victoria Li, For Peace of Mind, I'm a driver, a seasoned driver. For security, I fasten the seat belt. For happiness, I take on a road trip. For Peace of Mind, I buy insurance. So what exactly is Peace of Mind? Raise your hand if you ever talked with the insurance agent. Thank you. My translation you will be covered when you don't expect things strike you. However, can insurance alone guarantee me real Peace of Mind?

In 2020, ten years after getting my driver license, I finally bought my first car insurance mandatory. As I'm reviewing the sales contract, I saw a line of 1.5 million RMB coverage option. Seriously. I asked a sales consultant and he gave me a look. Heart exasperation. Heart. Remove the calculation, I suppose to say. Haha, another rookie to be educated. Madam, the million man is 1,000,000. But in this city, with all the luxury cars on the road, don't you want more Peace of Mind? To verify, I called a friend, a veteran driver. Hey, how much courage should I get? He didn't hesitate to paint me a picture. Imagine if you hit a car with a family inside, 2 parents, one kid injuries easily 500,000 RMP per person. That will be 1.5 million. You want more Peace of Mind? Stop being cheap OK? 1.5 million for Peace of Mind. I didn't want to crush, I didn't want to go bankrupt. I started papers and I promised myself Dr. carefully stay safe.

On the very first day with my car, I drove to get my driver license license plate. As I pulled into the local traffic management office, I saw AFC space but narrow lane. Can I make the term without reversing? I mentally calculated the gap against the wall on my on and off driving for 10 years. I should be able to handle it. The turn wheel and the second scrap filled air. I had just scratched my brand new car against the wall and the inspection officer came over checked the last first day. That woman told me something. Insurance I can compensate for the damage, but it kind of stopped me from making my mistakes. If I want real freedom from worry, a true sense of calm and Peace of Mind on the road, I better work on my own driving skills or at least avoid hitting those stationary objects.

Near 1. I drove slowly and cautiously and maybe full cautiously. Other cars cut me off Luckily, no accident. Year 2. I speed up, I become confident. Still no accident. Year three. Confidence turned into overconfidence. I started to cut into other people's lands and I've got to speaking but no speeding ticket. Year 4 overconfidence turned into complacency. On a trip to a county I tried to squeeze across the construction poles. Another scrap stand as day one. Year 5 complacency led to more overlooking. After a peaceful afternoon in a garden, I turned a wheel not to park but to exit the garden and I hit a tree in an empty lot every time. Insurance paid, but with every claim the premium went up. They increased the premium. How lovely we will be if I can use it for a rounded trip, let's say. OK, that's long. I renewed my premium again on the same night I fumble in the dark. I forgot how to turn on the high. Been. Have you ever found? Have you ever found your piece of money shaken not by some major disaster, but by your own lack of a preparation? Forgetting basics or realizing maybe you have been on the Oval planet for a little too long. Insurance. They give me some Peace of Mind. But not all.

Life is a journey and like every journey it comes with surprises and having external reassurance absolutely matters. Think about it, every product we use promises something. A guided promises security. The plan promises happiness and service promises prevention. Fasten the seat belt. Have a road trip. Buy the insurance. Each one offers a little comfort, reassurance and security along the way. But the real Peace of Mind? It doesn't come from what we buy. It comes from how we drive, how we live. I'm the one who's turning the wheel. So are we stay alert, stay aware, stay committed, or risk driving blood? It starts with one decision we all can make to be part to become better, to drive wisely and live wholeheartedly. And that's not something a third party insurance ever replace. But it was myself.

## Evaluation Session (Agenda: 20:28 - 20:57)
(Approx. Duration: 37 minutes, 24 seconds)

Georgi Beloev (Toastmaster of the Evening):
Oh, I want to animated and funny speech. I especially laughed at the part where you hit the tree at an empty parking lot. And to tell you the truth, I can completely relate to the part where you scratch the car on on the wall. I have done exactly the same thing with my first car, so we're the same in that respect. Anyway, so a big round of applause for Victoria again. And with that, we move to our evaluation session. Like I said before, we will have evaluations for the meeting overall as well As for the speeches that you just heard from these wonder fiction speakers.

When I asked the general evaluation general evaluator of the meeting how to introduce, you just said, oh, I'm a speech. No, he's actually a fairly expert public speaker. He has won first place at the District 85 evaluation competition, and he always delivers engaging and engaging speeches and evaluations. So let's warmly welcome John Zhang to the stage.

John Zhang (General Evaluator):
I think now it's time for us to get a little bit more in doping because every time right for speakers come onto the stage and for every participants likes when we go to TOES master meeting, we want to improve and we hear that feedback. And when we feel like a little bit more growth, we feel that a little bit more in doping. So let's dive into the evaluation session and I'd like to welcome our first individual evaluator for our first speaker, Samantha Yan: Kyle Wei.

Kyle Wei (Evaluator 1):
Oh, Samantha just first came to the stage and gave the first sentence. I kind of feel my heart has already been meltdown. You do love it. We have the dads here in our audience. Do you want to have a daughter like her? Fine. You do not. So basically Samantha told us a story about. Ugly darkly have a one set in love towards her preference. This kind of things like that. My interpretation not may may not be very accurate. So this is my first time to give a evaluation. I decided to borrow some help from the the we we have a full horse of the audience and a great a lot of great evaluators. So probably I will ask you a few questions and you just raise hand, OK. Take it as one of my feedback. Do you think her story is very clear? If you think raise your hand, Yeah, wow, we have a lot of hand. Secondly, do you feel that her story is very engaging? You just stay to the story to the end, right? And the last one, they must. Semester wants to know if she's natural and is expressive on the stage. Do you think so? So you did a great job, but I need to come to come back to your purpose of this speech. It is about a vocal variety and your body language. I think she well demonstrated her proficiency in using the vocal language, right, Vocal variety. So someone might know the background of this little girl. She's the English teacher and we have a lot of great top speakers in this room. In this club. I never heard a lot of great speeches. So I basically raise the bar a little bit higher. I have some additional expectation on you. You make good use of the stage. That is perfect. But sometimes I, I'm not quite sure what that means, Right. So if You Can Dance, you're a good dancer, you're a little girl, and you have one second love for a press when the police approaches you. Oh, this, this is what I expect to see, right. Give a little drama to the story. Yeah, this is my point a little. Yeah, this could be a challenge. Another one is again, you, you've been you've been doing a very good job. But if your local variety go to the stream, stream, not just see some screaming and some noise, hey, you can do that, can you next time? Thank you very much.

John Zhang (General Evaluator):
Well, thank you for turning the evaluation into a very humorous speech. I really love that. OK, At least I think that's the first time. Individual evaluator. A lot of times we feel the pressure and maybe we don't likes have the courage to share the feedback with the audience members, with our speakers. But Kyle, definitely I think you have that courage and that's what matters. Likes to, you know, leadership members and to me. OK, really good job. Now moving on our second individual evaluator. Hey, he's the one likes I also look up to. He doesn't take a lot of individual evaluation, but he always has got this piercing eyes picking out the spots. No, I'm like in a good way, OK, He can always pick out, you know, like really constructive, like the feedback and areas for improvements for like our speakers and for our members. So let's put our hands together to welcome our second individual evaluator, Vijay Basang.

Vijay Basang (Evaluator 2):
Sorry, yeah. Yeah. But you just understand this. First of all, I hope that I can deliver some endorphins to our speaker. Do you all enjoy the speech? And do you all now know what endorphins are? Everyone. Excellent. Let's let's just see, take a quick recap as to what faded very well in her speech. The first thing she did, she opened with two questions. The very first thing she came here, she said, let me ask you 2 questions. She asked 2 questions. This is great because it immediately engages the audience like before you. That's a nice hook to automatically get the audience and you all in your speech. So great start. I really like the fact that she had cue cards. So she had, if you remember, she picked up a card, the endorphin and the Chinese word fendorphin. So she didn't have slides, but that was a nice way to still pass on the message. Even if you don't know the English word, then you know the Chinese words. It's it's both very clear. So that's very great. The third thing was very good was her structure. So she started with explaining what the word is, a little bit of history into the word, how it can benefit us. So the whole thing had a nice flow. So for this great speech, let's give Faith a great round of applause.

What can Faith do to improve one thing? One suggestion is, I think I thought the first cue card was very nice because it it amplified the word and gave us a meaning. The next cue cards, I'm not so sure if it added much value. So because I the the drawback of using cue cards is you were stuck to this position, so you didn't get the chance to move and address the audience from different places. So if you didn't have cue cards, you wouldn't be anchored to this one position. So that's one thing to consider. Secondly, some of them were really small. So it it's not slide, it's kind of big fonts. You can see you had things like I don't know what's Hippothalamus or something, some very scientific sounding words. So that kind of stuff probably avoid or if not have it not written very small because then it's not serving the purpose of the audience. Yeah. And the third and last suggestion that I have is enunciate. There's one thing I've learned. So I found that some words you're trying to speed over very fast. And I can give you one helpful advice that I've received as well on how can you improve this enunciation, right? So I mean, for everyone in the audience, what's it? You can take a pen or a chopstick or anything flat like this. Yeah, keep it in your mouth and do practice your speech or practice speaking with that. It's going to be very hard, but it will help you really open your mouth wide to pronounce words and enunciate. That's very important because you might have the greatest vocabulary, the greatest things to say. But the if, if a word is lost in translation or lost to the audience and it it, it loses the meaning. So make effort to pronounce each word. And one helpful benefit is use a pen and practice reading your speech or a song or anything. Yeah. And I think the greatest part of Faye's speech for me was the way she connected with the audience. She had a very pleasant smile through the speech that helped us relate and break the ice with her. So I really look forward to the next speeches from Faye. Thank you very much.

John Zhang (General Evaluator):
I really love, like, how VJ demonstrate us to us, like how we can work on the enunciation. So I guess like next time we will find some like, hard bitten pencils at home, right? That'd be nice. Yes. All right, now moving on, let's put our hands together to welcome one of our precious DTM distinguished Toastmasters, Sir Paul William James. Give me back to our pressure member, Victoria. OK.

Paul William James (Evaluator 3):
Yes. Where is Victoria? Oh, yeah, very well. So, so to everyone and Victoria, this is my evaluation for you. So Victoria is doing her 4.1 present, not present. Was it finding your sense of which pathway persuasive influence. So she's and she's finding her sense of humour. And let me tell you this is finding your sense of humour is one of the last things that you do when you're on your looking at skill craft or speech craft. So how many times did she make you laugh? I can tell you exactly how counted. She made everyone laugh 6 times. So these are 6 laughter points. And how did she make people laugh? So what did she do? Well, well #1 she was very confident. Did you notice the confidence that she had? And if you looked around, you'd see that she was very captivating because everyone's eyes were on it. I didn't see anyone looking at their phone. We couldn't even hear anything but you. So and also you were very, very passionate. So I think we can give her a big round of applause. I also, she made that connection and she used language, used triads. So stay awake, stay aware, and stay connected. So definitely got all those speech girls.

How can she improve speed? Well #1 and I think we all know it. We hear this time after time. If you go back, especially in my time, go back a few years here you have a record player and there's a figure speed called 78 on a record player and it's very, very fast. We could blah, blah, blah, and you can slow it down, but your speed is on a 70, OK? It's very, very fast, very, very far. And it's like, well, when are you going to slow down? When are you going to stop? I listen to stories on my headphones and sometimes it's very, very far. You need to slow down. And that's where vocal variety comes in. So you can slow it down and slow it down. And also not just that it's your pitch. Have you noticed that she's got a very high pitch? So if you can exaggerate that, you can make it, you can make, are you going to slow it down? And you can make your voice deeper. So try that. See, I didn't even tend to make it 1, but by by varying your vocal variety, that's a great thing. Another thing, another too, is that there's too much content in your speech. We had the first year, the second year, the third year, the 4th year. This insurance I it's like it's too complicated. I was reminded of a story that my sister told me about when she crashed her car into a brick wall. She told the story how someone went in front of her, how she went into the brick wall and how she was devastated and she told that for hours and hours and hours. Just tell first one thing. Don't tell us about all these different things over five years and this, this, this and this. Agent, it's too complicated. My mind, your minds can't take it. It's all right. It's like, what the Hell's going on? Simplify it. Virtual variety. And one more thing way too serious, you know, sit down and relax. And if you do that, then we'll all laugh and we'll all follow your lovely story and we'll follow your amazing vocal transformation as you go up the scales and down the scales.

John Zhang (General Evaluator):
Personally, I really love post evaluation because sometimes, you know, you can feel that passion and when someone goes into that zone and they are unstoppable and really like admire your energy and the passion, they're always like a role model to look up to. Now as the general evaluator, I like to give a little bit more feedback based on my observation and we can improve overall, like for the entire meeting and for our role takers. Let's move on. First of all, I think I want to thank all the audience members here because to be honest, at the beginning, I thought you came for AFU, but now after AFU left, you're still staying here. And also one thing that touched me a lot there was you were really good at using your hands, creating the platinum sounds. And that is the clap. Yes. Not, not you don't need to clap for me, but at like, I mean, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because I think some sometimes being the audience and the best way to show support to someone and the direct way to show that is from our applause and sitting back there, especially like I can hear things we need to. OK, they can stop. Yeah. Then you come back after you come back after role taker. Give the report. Thank you. You're right. OK, thank you. Yes. Now I'd like to introduce the role takers. OK. Yes. Thank you for the reminder. Yes. Right now, I'd like to welcome our counter Eva back onto the stage.

Eva Koudelkova (Ah-Counter):
OK. So guys, I don't know whether to say congratulations because there were over 100 other words and repetition, though maybe I'm just a very hard taskmaster. The most common was the word ah and repeats. So that's when people said, for example, I was, I was OK, which is quite common. We have a couple of our kings who were Thomas and Paul, but they did speak for probably some of the longest, so that's understandable. But let's focus on the positives. The first of all, I want to say that a lot of speakers did not say any ads or arms, and those speakers were Victoria, Dane and Corey. So also quite a few of the new members in their introductions didn't use any pillar sounds, which is amazing. OK. I also want to say that they said a lot of difficult words with them, a lot of difficult technical words with no fillers whatsoever, which is amazing. And finally, a lot of speakers use reformulation, so correcting themselves in terms of their grammar and vocabulary, which shows a very high controlled lining range. So well done.

John Zhang (General Evaluator):
Our next Rd. taker is already on stage. Grace.

Grace Wang (Grammarian):
Yes, just take the stage, catch up on time. Yes. All right, Thank you guys for letting me report on the grammar this evening. So we used the word of the day, tenacious 8 times, Nothing. And thank you for using twice. So that was great. Let me go into a few of the speakers and I did get a challenge from AFU during his speech to criticize him. So please make sure to film this and send this to him after I will tell him. But firstly, he did a great job. Of course I'm sure the entire audience can concede to that. Boxing as a using boxing as a metaphor for life when you get beat down. But do you guys remember what his first piece of advice was? Negative. Think negative right? Or think positive, is that grammatically correct? If I had to nitpick, think negatively, think negatively is the correct actual grammar usage. So that was just the only thing that I could find from his entire speech and I needed to be a bit nitpicky on that. And then you have we had Samantha who had a once I had a dream, a very dreamy magical speech and something that she did very well. I think all the women and girls in this room would want is I wish she could know me. So that one, that sentence really stuck out and was a really good descriptor of how a girl would feel. And Georgie used the word enchanted to describe that as a, you know, as a, as a positive feedback on that speech. So I think the entire speech was indeed very dreamy. So the third Faye, I had a few things in terms of using that internal pharmacist and filling your prescription with endorphins was a really good way of describing the way that we can use the way that we can use our minds to exercise. There's one last .1 of the things that I would really like to point out is the use of extra prepositions. When you were speaking, you used a lot of to make make you to feel, make your brain to generate, make you to happy. So some variations of that give you joy, command your brain, provide signals to your brain that that would actually help vary your grammar and your use of words.

John Zhang (General Evaluator):
So at least we won't have our timer the Zach. *(Note: Timer Buzzara did not present report, GE summarizes)* It's so it's going to blame our keynote speaker because he introduced a lot of unexpected events to a meeting, but so in result we have 5 minutes behind the agenda. However, first of all, our new guests did really great by finishing within 20 seconds. That was huge surprise. And then our table topics also, everyone did great except Corey who went way over time and she really was 2 seconds over as well. And for our prepared speakers, everyone did great. Samantha, you could use a little like minute, one minute more. And our evaluators, Kyle and Vijay, so immediately they saw red card, great job. And Paul finished with a well. So try better next time. So back to G Thank you. 646 minutes. Thank you. Thank you for the reminder and thank you to the crowd.

All right, I think I already made a point and now let's move on. After that, let's move on to our toastmaster of the evening. Yes, I think Yogi did wonderful job and he's not just handsome, very, very charming because because I think he's way of using humor. And when we use the humor, we can engage the audience members. But another thing I think that's when a hostmaster stand on the stage and how can you tell that you can make that connection with the keynote speaker? It is when you use your personal experience and when you tell your personal story how you benefited from the speaker. And I think Yogi, you gave a lot of efforts and for the introduction, it's not just about sharing those titles. We don't need to talk about the keynote speaker has got all these achievement. Yeah, they are important, but sometimes if we do a little bit like. The personal experience, like the story and how you benefit that from that, I think that's sometimes the strongest introduction that we can to give to the speaker. So you're giving to a lot. You're getting that demonstrated now. One thing I like to encourage you be like also for the members. Maybe in the future, right when you become the OR Hostess at your company or as a Toastmaster events, what we can do, We can take the center stage a little bit more because I felt maybe you wanted to give more attention to the speakers, so you stood on the sides. But you are also a very important role taker, and I want you to take the center stage, welcome the speaker, and then we can give this stage to them. So that's what I want to share with Yogi.

Moving on for SAA team, also with Yogi's help, right. We made the room very, very hot. But also at the same time, we demonstrate our flexibility right now. Are you feeling comfortable? Yeah. So then I think this is also the great part of the really nice teamwork. We notice about like the conditions and we want to create the best conditions for the audience members. And so sometimes we think about how can we make the audience members listen to our speeches and they really enjoy the events. We need to pay attention to the details and sometimes it comes to the room temperature. So good job for our leadership team and our like members giving feedback and we figured it out without our role takers. I think thank you for being like very active listeners because I noticed that you gave a lot of really good examples you use directly about this is what I call the structure that we can use. And since we're talking about active listening, Avril, Avril, I'm also giving like the the feedback here. OK, So Admiral as the table topic master, she's also doing active listening. And I think the great structure that we can use if we want to demonstrate active listening, have to use this. And we can call this I just made it up, But I, I noticed there is a pattern, I called it RRE, like repeat, recognize. And then you can encourage, OK, what does it mean? So like when we demonstrate active listening, first thing, we're giving that to one person, right? And what is like the most pleasant sound in the world, the person's name, right? If the table topic speaker gave a really nice speech and then we say, hey, Bing, you did a wonderful job, right? So we're glad to hear that name. And I think for our like role takers, you did a wonderful job, especially like name from Grace. You were the grammarian. You were giving the reports you're mentioning those like specific names who did very, very well. And we will change, improve. OK. So I think this is one step that we can take. Another one is we can do recognize, so we need to show our active listening. What did the speaker say? Maybe instead of talking about directly, talking about like what we think about us, what the speaker did or what the speaker talked about, we can talk about what the speaker just said. So that can really show our objectivity. And then when other people, they hear that, how would they feel? They feel like, hey, that's something I said. And immediately, very quickly, you can get a yes from your listener, from your audience. And then we need to keep in mind, right, we want the speakers to continue to enjoy, give their speeches. So the last step we can do is to encourage a little bit more. So maybe next time, if you want to be, you know, like we use the active listening and we want to view that those precious connections we can always repeat, recognize, and we can always encourage a little bit more.

So that's what I want to share with what I recognized from our tabletop and Masters and our role takers. Good job for our individual evaluators. One thing that we can challenge ourselves a bit more. And then I think this is mainly about how I think we're all like very experienced, like good listeners, good evaluators, and we noticed there's some nice spots. But then what if we can take part of the speaker's speech and then demonstrate to the audience members? So here, this is a little bit challenging part. I think Paul did a good job, but it was like maybe 60% or 80% what we can do? Maybe we can take the exact lines from the speaker's speech and then demonstrate. Maybe for Victoria's pitch that was a bit too high, right? And we can say the line and we can show the exaggerated effects instead of making the sounds like the audience members. I think we got the point, but how can we show active listening? We can always repeat the line and the demonstrates the before and after. And that demonstration is a very effective way for us to give the evaluation. And also I think Kyle, this is your first time you did really, really well, but continue to work on this. Think about like the how and demonstrate that to our audience members. And that's everything what I have to share. Thank you.
