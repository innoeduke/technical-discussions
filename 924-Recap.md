# RECAP 924 | Broaden Your Perspective

What a **fascinating and perspective-shifting evening** we had on **April 16th** for Meeting #924! The theme, "Broaden Your Perspective," came to life in profound ways‚Äîhighlighted not only by our keynote speaker **Tilman Rieger**‚Äôs captivating deep dive into Near Death Experiences (NDEs) but also by **two momentous highlights** that anchored the night: the warm induction of **two new club members** and the honor of welcoming **Randal Eastman**, a heavyweight guest whose far-reaching contributions have left an indelible mark on the Chinese Toastmasters community and deeply shaped the landscape of Toastmasters in China.

Guided skillfully by our Toastmaster of the Evening, **Cathy Ma**, the meeting navigated complex topics with sensitivity and curiosity. If you missed this unique session or wish to revisit the key moments and insights shared, this recap captures the highlights!

## Opening & Welcome

Our President, **Katarina Milanovic**, then took the stage, providing context about **Toastmasters International's history** (over 100 years old) and highlighting our club's unique international diversity (members from 21 regions). She also paid homage to **Helen M. Blanchard**, the first woman officially admitted to Toastmasters 50 years ago, emphasizing her importance for the club's inclusivity.

## Keynote Speech: Broaden Your Perspective

**Tilman Rieger** delivered a captivating keynote focused on **Near Death Experiences (NDEs)**, drawing from extensive research and personal fascination:

- Tilman began by weaving together common elements of NDE accounts into a single, powerful story. He shared how reading Anita Moorjani's book and subsequent deep dives into YouTube testimonials, books (Bruce Greyson, Raymond Moody, Jeffrey Long), podcasts, and expert interviews fueled his fascination over the past 3+ years. 
- Tilman highlighted the profound, life-altering effects NDEs often have on experiencers: **loss of fear of death, career changes towards service, increased empathy, and sometimes psychic abilities.**
- He cited Dr. Eben Alexander, a neuroscientist whose own NDE shifted his skepticism. NDEs challenge the standard materialistic view that the brain produces consciousness, suggesting instead that the brain might be a receiver or filter for a broader consciousness/soul/mind.
- Tilman encouraged exploring the data (books, websites like NDERF.org, testimonials), finding hope in the possibility of continued existence and reunion, and embracing the core messages often brought back: **love, learn, experience, be authentic, and have fun.**

## Table Topics

**Lili Wu**, our **Table Topics Master**, led an engaging session cleverly themed around the keynote, prompting speakers with questions related to life and death. Six individuals who shared their thoughts. They are: **Keeva McCotter, Fedir, Shelley He, Cloris, Joel, and Shirley Li**. **Keeva** delivered **the Best Table Topics Speech** by sharing a harrowing story of a turbulent flight, developing a severe fear of flying, her 10-year coping mechanism (alcohol), and finally facing the fear sober, emphasizing pushing comfort zones to survive and overcome.

## New Member Induction & New Guest Greetings

The club was thrilled to welcome two fantastic new members to the SHLTMC family. Victoria and Andrew, led by VPM **Margarita Lozovskaya**, shared fascinating 90-second speeches as new members.

-   **Victoria Matveeva:** Shared her journey from being terrified at her first meeting (**"dangerously talented people!"**) to winning Table Topics that same night, thanks to the club's supportive atmosphere. She spoke about realizing Toastmasters helps build leaders who connect, not just speak, and embracing discomfort for growth.
-   **Andrew Power:** Related to Victoria's initial hesitation, sharing his own year-long journey from first attending (in April!) to finally joining (in April!). He credited the club's diverse and welcoming nature (**"the best, most diverse Toastmasters"**) and encouraged guests to **"just dive into it."**

**Victoria**'s mentor will be **John Zhang**, and **Fred Zhang** will provide mentorship to **Andrew**.

**New Guest Greetings:**
**To everyone‚Äôs delight**, the club was honored to welcome a very special guest tonight‚Äî**Randal Eastman**‚Äîthe visionary who brought Toastmasters to China in **1999** and founded the nation‚Äôs first club in **Shanghai**.

We also extended a warm welcome to our distinguished guests: **Richard Fung**, **Tina**, **Mia Cao**, **Wilson**, *(and other honored attendees)*

A special thanks to **Randal** and **Mia** for taking the individual evaluator roles too.

## Prepared Speeches

Three members delivered compelling prepared speeches:

-   **Ruddy Swinnen - "You Are Your Worst Counterpart!" (Dynamic Leadership 3.1: Negotiate the Best Outcome):** Ruddy shared his personal history of navigating major life changes (military service, career shifts from finance to HR/psychology, moving to China, starting his own company) as a series of negotiations with his "inner self." He emphasized identifying non-negotiables and aligning with one's inner voice, heart, and mind to courageously achieve the best outcomes.
-   **Fanghua Li - "Asking Expert" (Persuasive Influence 3.1: Understanding Conflict Resolution):** Fanghua humorously detailed the daily "disaster" of conflicts at home with his wife and mother-in-law over getting his young kids ready in the morning and fed properly in the evening. Finding himself without authority, his solution was to "ask the expert" ‚Äì the kindergarten teacher ‚Äì whose simple rules, when communicated clearly, resolved the long-standing issues.
-   **John Zhang - "A Masterpiece" (Presentation Mastery 4.1: Generic Speech Project):** John painted a vivid scene of working on a Bali beach, feeling out of place. 

Congratulations to **John Zhang** for delivering **the Best Prepared Speech**!

## Evaluation Session

**Lewis Bacon**, serving as **General Evaluator**, led a thorough and constructive evaluation session.

**Speech Evaluations:**

-   **Victoria Li** evaluated Ruddy Swinnen.
-   **Mia Cao evaluated Fanghua Li:** Commended Fanghua's humorous, relaxed delivery and clear achievement of the project's purpose (sharing conflict resolution). Suggested deepening the *feeling* of conflict for more impact and making the "ask an expert" solution more universally applicable beyond the specific family scenario.
-   **Randel Eastman evaluated John Zhang:** Lauded John's theatrical stage use, distinct character voices, natural gestures, and the text structure. 

**Technical Role Reports:**

-   **Ah-Counter (Fernando Luciano):** Found it challenging due to the high quality of speaking but noted some fillers. Highlighted **Cloris** as the "queen" of a favorite word ("florist") during Table Topics. Commended the overall high level.
-   **Grammarian (May Hang):** Noted the Word of the Day **"Mutual Understanding"** was used (by Fanghua after a whisper!). Praised creative language ("negotiate with yourself," "little potato") and noted minor points like "airline" vs. "alien." Offered detailed written feedback (7 pages!).
-   **Timer (Kyle Wei):** In additional to reporting time usage, **Kyle** brought up an meaningful question--how can timer provide effective signaling without disrupting?

**General Evaluator's Encouraging Remarks:**  
Lewis delivered thoughtful, well-rounded feedback that elevated the meeting. He gracefully addressed room dynamics (audience noise, photographer placement) while reinforcing the importance of speaker focus‚Äîa testament to his commitment to a respectful learning environment.  

**Role-Specific Highlights & Growth Opportunities:**  
- **Fernando:** Strong delivery with a *great tip* to experiment with pauses for added impact.  
- **May:** Creative introduction that energized the room‚Äîkeep innovating!  
- **Kyle:** Diligent timekeeping; his consistency anchors the meeting.  
- **TME Cathy Ma:** Exceptionally prepared with smooth transitions and audience connection. *Next-level tip:* Inspired by Ruddy/Fanghua, purposeful stage movement could further amplify her dynamism.  
- **TT Master Lili Wu:** Engaging session! Slightly shorter intros would maximize participant speaking time‚Äîa small tweak with big potential.  
- **New Member/Guest Session:** Warm and inclusive! Even clearer instructions will help newcomers dive in confidently.
- **Mia:** Commanding stage presence! Reducing note reliance will let her natural charisma shine brighter.  
- **Randal:** Deep, experience-driven evaluations. Demonstrating suggestions live (e.g., "Try this posture") would make his expertise even more actionable.  

**Final Note:** Lewis balanced praise with actionable advice, leaving every member feeling *both valued and empowered to grow*.
