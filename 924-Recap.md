# RECAP 924 | Broaden Your Perspective

What a fascinating and perspective-shifting evening we had on **April 16th** for **Meeting #924**! The theme, **"Broaden Your Perspective,"** was explored in profound ways, most notably through our keynote speaker **Tilman Rieger**, who took us on a deep dive into the intriguing world of Near Death Experiences (NDEs). The agenda was packed, featuring not only the compelling keynote but also engaging impromptu speaking, insightful prepared speeches, constructive evaluations, and the warm induction of new members.

Guided skillfully by our Toastmaster of the Evening, **Cathy Ma**, the meeting navigated complex topics with sensitivity and curiosity. If you missed this unique session or wish to revisit the key moments and insights shared, this recap captures the highlights!

## Opening & Welcome

The meeting commenced with **SAA Bruscusse Ndzoho** welcoming everyone and reminding us of the club's open environment (everything except taboo topics!). Our President, **Katarina Milanovic**, then took the stage, providing context about **Toastmasters International's history** (over 100 years old) and highlighting our club's unique international diversity (members from 21 regions). She also paid homage to **Helen M. Blanchard**, the first woman officially admitted to Toastmasters 50 years ago, emphasizing her importance for the club's inclusivity.

## TME Introduction & Role Explanations

Toastmaster of the Evening **Cathy Ma** warmly welcomed everyone, setting the stage for an insightful session and comparing her role to an "evening tour guide." She expertly introduced the key technical role-takers for the evening:

-   **Ah-Counter:** **Fernando Luciano**, tasked with noting filler words and repetitions.
-   **Grammarian:** **May Hang**, responsible for tracking language usage, highlighting good examples, noting areas for improvement, and introducing the Word of the Day: **Mutual Understanding**.
-   **Timer:** **Kyle Wei**, emphasizing the importance of time management in Toastmasters and explaining the signal light system.

## Keynote Speech: Broaden Your Perspective

**Tilman Rieger** delivered a captivating keynote focused on **Near Death Experiences (NDEs)**, drawing from extensive research and personal fascination:

-   **Composite NDE Narrative:** Tilman began by weaving together common elements of NDE accounts into a single, powerful story: the out-of-body experience (OOBE), observing medical efforts, feeling no pain, floating through walls, encountering a tunnel/light, feelings of unconditional love and homecoming, meeting deceased relatives (telepathic communication), experiencing hyper-real colors/bliss, undergoing a life review (experiencing effects of one's actions on others), and being told "it's not your time."
-   **Personal Journey & Research:** He shared how reading Anita Moorjani's book and subsequent deep dives into YouTube testimonials, books (Bruce Greyson, Raymond Moody, Jeffrey Long), podcasts, and expert interviews fueled his fascination over the past 3+ years.
-   **Transformative Impact:** Tilman highlighted the profound, life-altering effects NDEs often have on experiencers: loss of fear of death, career changes towards service, increased empathy, and sometimes psychic abilities. He cited Dr. Eben Alexander, a neuroscientist whose own NDE shifted his skepticism.
-   **Veridical Perception & Evidence:** He shared anecdotes suggesting consciousness operates outside the brain, such as patients accurately describing events they couldn't have physically witnessed (e.g., the nurse's car crash, the blind woman seeing details).
-   **Scientific Challenge:** NDEs challenge the standard materialistic view that the brain produces consciousness, suggesting instead that the brain might be a receiver or filter for a broader consciousness/soul/mind.
-   **Key Message & Call to Action:** Tilman encouraged exploring the data (books, websites like NDERF.org, testimonials), finding hope in the possibility of continued existence and reunion, and embracing the core messages often brought back: love, learn, experience, be authentic, and have fun.

During the brief Q&A, Tilman discussed the difficulty of convincing rational skeptics, the difference between NDEs and meditation (though meditation can be a tool for reconnection), and shared personal "synchronicity" experiences rather than a full NDE.

## Table Topics

**Lili Wu**, our **Table Topics Master**, led an engaging session cleverly themed around the keynote, prompting speakers with questions related to life, death, and the supernatural:

-   **Keeva McCotter:** Responded to "Do you have any near-death moment happen in your life?" sharing a harrowing story of a turbulent flight, developing a severe fear of flying, her 10-year coping mechanism (alcohol), and finally facing the fear sober, emphasizing pushing comfort zones to survive and overcome.
-   **Fedir:** Tackled "What do you think about the ghosts? Is it a cultural myth or psychology illusion or something more?" He pivoted to discussing belief in a higher power/universe, shared miracles vs. coincidence, and used the "red car theory" to illustrate how noticing and appreciating positive experiences attracts more.
-   **Shelley He:** Addressed "If you can have one supernatural power, what would it be and why?" but chose to share her own near-death experience: nearly drowning as a child after being hit by a flipped inflatable wheel, being rescued by a man in red underwear (her "hero"), and humorously looking for him in pools ever since.
-   **Cloris:** Responded to "What's your bucket list if you have one year left?" humorously discussing the societal/family pressure to get married as she approached 36, contrasting it with her own desire for independence, leading to a funny interaction about finding a single man in the audience.
-   **Joel:** Tackled "If the static offered to tell you one truth about your future, would you accept it or not?" He vividly imagined encountering a psychic, weighed the choice of knowing a potentially negative but true future, and ultimately decided he'd rather retreat and let life unfold as a mystery.
-   **Shirley Li:** Addressed "If aliens will visit our earth tomorrow... what non-threatened question would you ask them and why?" She expressed curiosity about their planet, their way of life (peace, love, medical tech), and whether they experience happiness like humans, hoping for a deeper conversation.

Congratulations to **Keeva McCotter** for delivering the Best Table Topics Speech!

## New Member Induction & New Guest Greetings

Our VP of Membership, **Margarita Lozovskaya**, hosted a wonderful session welcoming new additions and first-timers.

**New Member Induction:**
We officially welcomed two fantastic new members to the Shanghai Leaders family!

-   **Victoria:** Shared her journey from being terrified at her first meeting ("dangerously talented people!") to winning Table Topics that same night, thanks to the club's supportive atmosphere. She spoke about realizing Toastmasters helps build leaders who connect, not just speak, and embracing discomfort for growth.
-   **Andrew:** Related to Victoria's initial hesitation, sharing his own year-long journey from first attending (in April!) to finally joining (in April!). He credited the club's diverse and welcoming nature ("the best, most diverse Toastmasters") and encouraged guests to "just dive into it."

Victoria and Andrew read the new member pledge, and their mentors (**John Zhang** for Victoria, **Fred** [in absentia] for Andrew) were acknowledged.

**New Guest Greetings:**
Margarita warmly welcomed our first-time guests, giving them 20 seconds to introduce themselves:

-   A guest (possibly **Richard Fung** based on later comments) returning after being a member previously, now part of China Advanced Toastmasters.
-   **Richard Fung**, introduced by Randall, shared his positive impression from his previous visit (Larry Schuster's evaluation) and appreciation for the inspiring speeches.
-   A guest whose wife is from **Vladivostok**.
-   **Tina**, here to improve English/public speaking, and unexpectedly learning about life after death!
-   **Wilson**, working in IT, attending his second TM meeting (first at this club), liking the warm atmosphere.
-   A guest from **St. Petersburg, Russia**.

A group photo was taken with the guests.

## Prepared Speeches

Three members delivered compelling prepared speeches:

-   **Ruddy Swinnen - "You Are Your Worst Counterpart!" (Dynamic Leadership 3.1: Negotiate the Best Outcome):** Ruddy shared his personal history of navigating major life changes (military service, career shifts from finance to HR/psychology, moving to China, starting his own company) as a series of negotiations with his "inner self." He emphasized identifying non-negotiables and aligning with one's inner voice, heart, and mind to courageously achieve the best outcomes.
-   **Fanghua Li - "Asking Expert" (Persuasive Influence 3.1: Understanding Conflict Resolution):** Fanghua humorously detailed the daily "disaster" of conflicts at home with his wife and mother-in-law over getting his young kids ready in the morning and fed properly in the evening. Finding himself without authority, his solution was to "ask the expert" – the kindergarten teacher – whose simple rules, when communicated clearly, resolved the long-standing issues.
-   **John Zhang - "A Masterpiece" (Presentation Mastery 4.1: Generic Speech Project):** John painted a vivid scene of working on a Bali beach, feeling out of place. He recounted a humorous and touching encounter with a ketchup-covered toddler ("Jack") who, after several determined attempts, finally "gifted" him a French fry sprinkled with sand – the "masterpiece." The experience highlighted connection beyond judgment and the beauty of seeing more and judging less.

Congratulations to **John Zhang** for delivering the Best Prepared Speech!

## Evaluation Session

**Lewis Bacon**, serving as **General Evaluator**, led a thorough and constructive evaluation session.

**Speech Evaluations:**

-   **Victoria Li evaluated Ruddy Swinnen:** Praised Ruddy's clear message about inner negotiation, effective body language, and use of rhetorical questions. Suggested explicitly linking the four negotiation styles (compete, accommodate, etc.) to different stages of his life story and using more intentional stage movement to represent past/future or different phases.
-   **Mia Cao evaluated Fanghua Li:** Commended Fanghua's humorous, relaxed delivery and clear achievement of the project's purpose (sharing conflict resolution). Suggested deepening the *feeling* of conflict for more impact and making the "ask an expert" solution more universally applicable beyond the specific family scenario.
-   **Randel Eastman evaluated John Zhang:** Lauded John's theatrical stage use, distinct character voices, natural gestures, and the recurring "Ah" structure. Recommended projecting his voice more, using more direct eye contact instead of gazing across the audience, and potentially making the "masterpiece" (French fry) a more central, built-up theme, or perhaps even titling the speech "Ah."

**Technical Role Reports:**

-   **Ah-Counter (Fernando Luciano):** Found it challenging due to the high quality of speaking but noted some fillers. Highlighted **Cloris** as the "queen" of a favorite word ("florist") during Table Topics. Commended the overall high level.
-   **Grammarian (May Hang):** Noted the Word of the Day **"Mutual Understanding"** was used (by Fanghua after a whisper!). Praised creative language ("negotiate with yourself," "little potato") and noted minor points like "airline" vs. "alien." Offered detailed written feedback (7 pages!).
-   **Timer (Kyle Wei):** Reported times for prepared speakers. Noted **Victoria** went over during her evaluation and discussed the timer's challenge of signaling without disrupting.

**General Evaluator's Overall Remarks:** Lewis provided comprehensive feedback. He started by evaluating himself (late start). He addressed audience noise and the potential distraction of the photographer on stage, emphasizing respect for speakers. He gave specific feedback to role-takers: **Fernando** (add 'pause' suggestion), **May** (creative intro), **Kyle** (diligent). He offered detailed praise and suggestions for TME **Cathy Ma** (well-prepared, smooth, good interaction, *major suggestion: incorporate meaningful stage movement like Rudy/Fanghua*). He advised **Lili Wu** (TT Master) to shorten introductions for more participation time. He commended the **New Member/Guest** session's warmth but suggested clearer instructions. He praised all three evaluators (**Victoria** - methodical but static; **Mia** - great presence but relied on notes; **Randel** - deep, experienced insights) while encouraging them to deliver evaluations without notes and physically demonstrate suggestions.
